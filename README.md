As a youth group of over 200 students, it has become difficult to manage the information as well as announcements from week to week.

In order for our church to save some trees and manage everything on one manageable and versatile application, some of our church members
have decided on collaborating on making something that would do so.

### GETTING STARTED

#### BUILT-WITH

```

  Languages and Database :
  
  Java
  Android Studio
  Firebase

```

### WEBSITE / IMAGES

#### Newsfeed

This is the screen that all application users (students and staff) will be introduced with upon entering the application.
Because students will not have accounts, they will have slightly less items to look at on this screen.
Announcements are grouped up between students and staff, however the staff will be able to see ALL announcements.

#### Registration/Login

Rather than giving every student their own account, it was more suitable to provide only the staff with an account because they were the ones that needed to document information on a weekly basis.
To ensure that students did not have access to creating an account as freely as the staff did, we provided a simple registration code to be prompted upon registration (different between teachers and staff since both parties have different viewing permissions).

#### Directory

To enable staff to be provided with easy-access information, the directory was made so that teachers would be able to view the information for their grade and that staff would be able to view all the student's information (by grade).
The directory provides the following information for each included student:
- Name
- Grade
- Address
- Phone Number
- Date of Birth

#### Logs

Every week, teachers must fill out a mandatory log sheet that provides details to how classes were on that day.
The main issue on the week to week basis was that each log sheet had to be printed out and handed in.

#### Response Cards

Along with logs needing to be printed out weekly, each student is handed a response card to be filled out weekly.
However, the real hassle is that a large majority of what we hand out becomes leftover garbage.
Being able to use this application to provide students with the ability to write prayer requests to staff on any day of the week as well as being able to choose who exactly gets to see their specific prayer request will hopefully provide optimal results.

#### Prayer Requests

On this screen, staff will be able to peruse the prayer requests submitted by the students via the 'Response Cards' section.
For optimal privacy, depending on what type of staff is using the application, they will have different viewing permissions.

#### Feedback

Lastly, because the application is still in the works, user engagement is the highest quality at the moment.
Once people from all over the church can provide their specific criticisms, necessary action can be done to provide a well-functioning application.
